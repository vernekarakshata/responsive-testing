#### Website Responsive Testing
This project shows on how we can test website's responsiveness with respect to mobile from web without having physical devices.
This project contains two different files one for [Known Mobile Devices](src/com/framework/KnownMobileDevice.java) and other for [Unknown Mobile Devices](src/com/framework/UnKnownMobileDevice.java).

Known mobile devices are those which are already available in any browser inspect page while unknown devices are those which we can check based on desired resolution.
